# pigs_health_recognition
This project implements a pig health monitoring system using audio-visual fusion and deep learning. It combines audio signals (coughing, breathing) and video data (behavioral changes) for accurate, real-time health assessment. The system features noise robustness, real-time performance, and cross-modal knowledge distillation.
